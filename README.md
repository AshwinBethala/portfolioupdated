# responsiveportfolio

This website has four pages that can be accessed: the main page, the portfolio page, the contact page, and the resume page.

The main page includes my photo, bio, and link to my LinkedIn page.

The portfolio page includes images that link to my project and homeworks, with the film image leading to a video on filmmaking (in the future I plan to insert a short film of my own). In addition, the GitHub pages are listed on the top as links.

The contact page includes a text box for email and general messages, including another link to my LinkedIn.

The resume page includes my resume, along with a PDF link.
